PrettyTable is a simple Python library designed to make it quick and easy to represent tabular data in visually appealing ASCII tables, like this:

```
+-----------+------+------------+-----------------+
| City name | Area | Population | Annual Rainfall |
+-----------+------+------------+-----------------+
| Adelaide  | 1295 |  1158259   |      600.5      |
| Brisbane  | 5905 |  1857594   |      1146.4     |
| Darwin    | 112  |   120900   |      1714.7     |
| Hobart    | 1357 |   205556   |      619.5      |
| Melbourne | 1566 |  3806092   |      646.9      |
| Perth     | 5386 |  1554769   |      869.4      |
| Sydney    | 2058 |  4336374   |      1214.8     |
+-----------+------+------------+-----------------+
```

PrettyTable lets you control many aspects of the table, like the width of the column padding, the alignment of text within columns, which characters are used to draw the table border, whether you even _want_ a border, and much more.  You can control which subsets of the columns and rows are printed, and you can sort the rows by the value of a particular column.

PrettyTable can also generate HTML code with the data in a `<table>` structure.  All of the options available for controlling ASCII tables are also available for HTML tables, except in cases where this would not make sense.
